%%% This module is the basis for a house process which manages the
%%%     entire simulation, acting as head of a supervisor tree in the
%%%     creation, turning on, and turning off of appliances either as
%%%     requested by a user or as needed according to power consumption.
%%% Integrates with user interface module to provide user visibility
%%%     and control.
%%% Able to create processes of Breaker and Appliance modules.
