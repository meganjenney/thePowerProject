%%% This module serves as the framework for Breaker processes which
%%%     supervise child appliances, manage power so its collection of
%%%     appliances doesn't exceed a breaker's limit, and handle
%%%     requests to create, turn on, and turn off individual appliances.
%%% Processes of this module can only be created by House processes.
%%% Able to create processes of Appliance modles.
